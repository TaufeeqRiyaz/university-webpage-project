            <hr class="three">
            <p> &#x27F6; Until 1904, the university only conducted examinations,
                 awarded affiliations to colleges, developed curricula, and produced 
                 guidelines for colleges developing curricula.[8] Teaching departments,
                  research disciplines, and post-graduate courses were introduced from 1904,
                   and several additional departments were established. After India achieved
                    independence in 1947, the functions and powers of the university were
                     re-organised under The Bombay University Act of 1953.The name of the
                      University was changed from University of Bombay to University of Mumbai
                       in 1996. </p>
